# Neurovision-AI-MRI
Neurovision-AI-MRI is an explainable AI platform that transforms neural network activity into a real-time anatomical brain simulation.

Instead of treating AI as a black box, this system exposes its internal cognitive process by combining:

• YOLOv10 object detection  
• CLIP semantic understanding  
• Grad-CAM visual explainability  
• PyTorch neural activation extraction  
• MRI-based anatomical brain mapping  
• Interactive 3D brain visualization  

The result is a digital brain that reveals how AI perceives, interprets, and decides — mapped directly onto real cortical regions.
